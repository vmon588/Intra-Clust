Cluster Identification
======================

Move into the scripts directory and run IntraClust.py as specified below.
Ex: For an input fasta filename of "test.fasta" in the seqfiles directory, using a patristic distance threshold of 0.03 and a tree support of 0.9:
python IntraClust.py -i ../seqfiles/test.fasta -a C -t1 0.03 -t2 0.9 -o ../results/clusterResults.txt -path ../Documents/
Deep sequencing Cluster Identification:
    Fasta file input
        1A) Reads must be unique.  Freeware to generate collapsed reads can be found here:
        FASTQ/A Collapser
        http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/
        Enter this file as:
        -i inputFile.fasta
        (extensions .fasta, .fas, or .fa are required)
        2A) The resulting file also has to have a unique identifier in each read that is specific to each sample/individual.
            You need to enter the length of this identifier and where it starts within the unique identifier for each fasta read.
            Enter this information as:
            -idL # -idS #
            where -idL specifies the length and and -idS specifies the starting location.
            Ex: all reads for individual A are labelled with A01 identifier
            >A01.1.1
            ACGTACGT
            -idS 1, -idL 3
        3A) If intrahost sequence data is available (multiple samples collected from the same individual), then needs to be put into 'Intrahost.txt'
            This file is used to assist the ete.DeepSequencingClusterID.py program, or specifically, to assist in the identification and removal of polyphyletic clusters.
            The unique identifiers for these samples are also required here (ex UID1, UID2 etc).
            This simple file format is as follows:
            UID1,UID2
            UID3,UID4
            where UID1 and UID2 are part of a single sequential set, and UID3 / UID4 are part of another.
        4A) If you prefer to use FastTree for phylogenetic tree reconstruction, you must provide the file pathway to locate FastTree
            Enter this information as:
            -p ../Documents/
            (NOT -p ../Documents/FastTree)
        

    Newick File Input
        1B) If a tree is already provided, a fasta file with the same file name other than the file extension, must also be provided in the same directory as the newick file.
        The fasta file does not need to be specified on the command line.
        2B) Sections 2A-4A are also required
        Enter this file as:
        -i inputFile.newick
        (extension is required to be either .newick, .tree, .nw, or .nwk)
    Output
    	-o specifies the output directory and filename.  
        Four or five files will be written to this directory: 
        	(1) the tree if specified (..newick)
        	(2) the pairwise patristic distances (..IntraGenotype.PatDist.txt)
        	(3) Patristic distance percentiles (..IntraGenotype.patdistspectrum.txt)
        	(4) outlier file (..IntraGenotype.Outliers.txt)
        	(5) Cluster results, which the user specifies (ex -o ../Documents/ClusterOutput.txt)
      
For Consensus/Sanger Sequencing:
    Fasta file input:
        1C) All sequences must have unique names
        Enter this file as:
        -i inputFile.fasta
        2C) If you prefer to use FastTree for phylogenetic tree reconstruction, you must provide the file pathway to locate FastTree
                Enter this information as:
                -p ../Documents/ (always ending in a forward slash)
    Newick File Input
        1D) If a tree is already provided, a fasta file with the same file name other than the file extension, must also be provided in the same directory.
        The fasta file does not need to be specified on the command line.
        2D) Section 1C is also required
        Enter this file as:
        -i inputFile.newick
    Output
    	-o specifies the output directory and filename.
    	Two to Three files will be generated:
    		(1) the tree if required (..newick)
    		(2) the pairwise patristic distances (..PatDist.txt)
    		(3) Cluster results, which the user specifies (ex -o ../Documents/ClusterOutput.txt)
    		
        
        
To get this information, type:
python IntraClust.py -h

usage: IntraClust.py [-h] -i infile -t1 threshold -t2 threshold

  -t1 threshold, --patristic distance threshold
                        Patristic Distance (Consensus sequencing (ex

  -oR [outlier], --outlierRem [outlier]
                        Required for deep seq analysis if outlier removal is
                        not needed (ex '-oR F'). Outliers are removed by
                        default (ex '-oR T' )
