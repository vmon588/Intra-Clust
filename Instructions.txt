Cluster Identification
======================

Move into the scripts directory and run IntraClust.py as specified below.
Ex: For an input fasta filename of "test.fasta" in the seqfiles directory:
python IntraClust.py -i ../seqfiles/test.fasta -a DS -t1 50 -t2 0.7 -idS 1 -idL 3 -intra Intrahost.txt -path ../Documents/ -oR F -o ../results/clusterResults.txt 
Deep sequencing Cluster Identification:
    
        1A) Input file: Either a Fasta or Newick tree file is required as input
            Fasta file: 
                Reads must be unique.  Freeware to generate collapsed reads can be found here:
                FASTQ/A Collapser
                http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/
                Enter this file as:
                -i inputFile.fasta
                (extensions required: .fasta, .fas, or .fa are required)
            Newick file:
                -i inputFile.newick
                (extensions required: .newick, .tree, .nw, or .nwk)
        2A) -a flag 
                specifies the type of analysis, DS = deep sequencing, and C = consensus (Sanger) sequencing
        3A) -t1 , -t2
            Threshold flags: Here the 50th percentile patristic distance threshold and a tree support threshold of 0.7 are used
        4A) -idL # -idS #
            The resulting file has to have a unique identifier in each read that is specific to each sample/individual.
            You need to enter the length of this identifier and where it starts within the unique identifier for each fasta read.
            where -idL specifies the length and -idS specifies the starting location.
            Ex: all reads for individual A are labelled with A01 identifier
            >A01.1.1
            ACGTACGT
            -idS 1 -idL 3
        5A) If intrahost sequence data is available (multiple samples collected from the same individual), then the -intra command                specifies the filename/location
            This file is used to assist the ete.DeepSequencingClusterID.py program to assist in the identification and removal of                 polyphyletic clusters.
            The unique identifiers for these samples are also required here (ex A01, A02 etc).
            This file format is as follows:
            A01,A02
            B01,B03
            where A01 and A02 are part of a single sequential set, and B01 / B03 are part of another.
        6A) -p
            If you prefer to use FastTree for phylogenetic tree reconstruction, you must provide the file pathway to locate FastTree
            Enter this information as:
            -p ../Documents/
        7A) -oR
            By default outliers are removed based on their relative position with the parental tree cluster
            This option can be removed with '-oR F'
        8A) -o
        	This specifies the output directory and filename.  
            Depending on your command line options, files will be written to this directory: 
            	(1) the tree if specified (..newick)
            	(2) the pairwise patristic distances (..IntraGenotype.PatDist.txt)
            	(3) Patristic distance percentiles (..IntraGenotype.patdistspectrum.txt)
            	(4) outlier file (..IntraGenotype.Outliers.txt)
            	(5) Cluster results, which the user specifies (ex -o ../Documents/ClusterOutput.txt)
      
For Consensus/Sanger Sequencing:
    Ex: For an input fasta filename of "test.fasta" in the seqfiles directory:
    python IntraClust.py -i ../seqfiles/test.fasta -a C -t1 0.03 -t2 0.7 -path ../Documents/ -o ../results/clusterResults.txt
    
    1B) Input file: Either a Fasta or Newick tree file input is required
        All sequences must have unique names
        Enter this file as:
        -i inputFile.fasta
        Same restrictions in filenames apply as above
    2B) -a
        analysis flag, C option specifies consensus sequencing
    3B) -t1, -t2
        Threshold flags: Here , a patristic distance threshold of 0.03 and a tree support threshold of 0.7 are used
    4B) If you prefer to use FastTree for phylogenetic tree reconstruction, you must provide the file pathway to locate FastTree
        Enter this information as:
        -p ../Documents/ (always ending in a forward slash)
    5B) -o
        Specifies the output directory and filename.
    	Two to Three files will be generated:
    		(1) the tree if required (..newick)
    		(2) the pairwise patristic distances (..PatDist.txt)
    		(3) Cluster results, which the user specifies (ex -o ../Documents/ClusterOutput.txt)
        
To get this information, type:
python IntraClust.py -h

  -oR [outlier], --outlierRem [outlier]
                        Required for deep seq analysis if outlier removal is
                        not needed (ex '-oR F'). Outliers are removed by
                        default (ex '-oR T' )
